#**_Hideous Metal Spectacular_**#


##**High Concept**##
It's a puzzle game/brain teaser in which the user is given some twisted puzzle pieces and needs to find how the pieces fit together given the grey silouhette on screen.

##**Platform**##
This game will be for the desktop only

##**Story**##
The big idea is for the user to be given some "pieces of scrap metal" to make a piece of art to go in a museum. The mood of the game is relaxed. As the player continues 
to assemble more pieces, the available levels get more difficult.

##**Esthetics**##
The graphics style will be abstract. The music will be ambient. There will be separate sounds for completeing a piece, selecting a level, and completeing a level.

##**Gameplay**##
###**Mechanics**###
The player can use the left mouse button to click and drag pieces into place and select which level to play.

###**Control**###
The instructions will be displayed at all times.

###**Player Learning**###
The player must comoplete all the levels in order to win the game;
